-**Overview**
-This project covers three types of IR sensors:
-IR Obstacle Avoidance Sensor: Used to detect obstacles.
-IR Distance Sensor: Measures the distance to an object.
-IR Receiver Module: Receives IR signals from a remote control.
-**Components**
-Arduino board (e.g., Uno, Nano, Mega)
-IR  Sensor
-Connecting wires
**Wiring**
-For IR Sensor:
-VCC (sensor) to 5V (Arduino).
-GND (sensor) to GND (Arduino).
-OUT (sensor) to a digital pin (e.g., pin 7).
-For Redled:
-long leg connected to the digital pin 8.
-small leg connected to the GND with the jumper wire.
-For Greenled:
-long leg connected to the digital pin 9.
-small leg connected to the GND with the jumper wire.
